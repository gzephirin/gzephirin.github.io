      <h2 class="header">Spotlight: Gila National Forest</h2>
          <p class="description"> Gila National Forest (GNF) is a wonderful stretch of wildlands in southwestern New Mexico. It is the 6th largest national forest in the United States, 
            covering over 2.7 million acres. This is a special place because it is one of the only true wildernesses left in the lower 48. While the deserts that surround
            GNF are sparsely vegetated and are largely devoid of life, GNF rises out of the deserts to create a "sky island," which has a shocking amount of animal and plant
           life. This national forest is special because it houses a shocking amount of ecosystem diversity. As you move from the lowlands (~6,200 ft. in elevation) to the 
           highest reaches (~10,600 ft. in elevation) you will encounter many different life zones, each sporting its own interesting and unique array of flora and fauna! </p>

    <h2 class="header">Spotlight: Otero County, CO</h2>
        <p class="description">Otero County, Colorado is the kind of place that most people would drive through and not think twice about it. The arid grasslands are a landscape that most people
          wouldn't think twice about, but what they don't know is that this landscape is one of the most diverse and suprisingly interesting in Colorado. Commanche National 
          Grasslands is nestled within this county and is an awesome place for anyone who loves wildlife or who is just seeking a little bit of peace and quiet! The grasslands
          are an often overlooked region in Colorado, but (if you know where to look) they hold a shocking amount of biodiversity!
